## Statement of Facts

On the evening of November 21, 2023, Isabella Moreno, a devoted 33-year-old dental hygienist for Bright Smile Dental Clinic, was making her way home after a long, diligent day. At approximately 5:42 pm, as the sun began to dip beneath the Phoenix skyline, Isabella’s sedan came to a responsible stop at the intersection of 7th Street and McDowell Road. Without warning, she was forcefully struck from behind by a 2015 Ford F-150, operated by Pedro Lopez (DOB 3/22/1985), who failed to maintain control and ensure proper distance—a clear breach of his duty as a motorist.

The collision was sudden and jarring, its impact reverberating through Isabella’s body and her life. The powerful rear-end crash was a textbook demonstration of negligence, with Mr. Lopez’s failure to adhere to basic roadway safety becoming painfully evident from the damage to Isabella’s vehicle and her person. Emergency personnel rushed to the scene, and Isabella was transported to Phoenix General Hospital for urgent assessment. The liability here is unambiguous: had Mr. Lopez exercised due caution, this traumatic event and all ensuing suffering would never have transpired.

## Injuries and Treatment Journey

In the days following the accident, what began as a stiff neck and soreness soon unraveled into profound pain and debilitation. Isabella was diagnosed with a cervical strain—commonly known as whiplash—accompanied by a lumbar strain and a significant contusion to her right shoulder. The relentless pain transformed routine moments, such as rising from bed or reaching across a counter, into constant reminders of the crash. 

Beyond the physical, Isabella began to experience anxiety and emotional distress. Ordinary activities that once provided solace—such as driving to work or enjoying time with family—now triggered waves of apprehension and unease.

Isabella’s path to recovery became a procession through specialized care: After initial evaluation and stabilization in the Phoenix General Hospital emergency room, she embarked upon weeks of focused treatment with Costa Vista Chiropractic, attended diagnostic imaging at Prime MRI Center, and sought neurological consultation at Valley Neurology Associates. With each appointment, Isabella hoped for relief that seemed just out of reach, enduring physical therapy, chiropractic adjustments, and a cascade of medications to manage pain and muscle spasms.

## Medical Findings and Diagnoses

Isabella’s medical journey was shaped and validated by objective evidence and expert scrutiny. Upon emergency room intake, physical examination revealed marked tenderness along her cervical and lumbar paraspinal muscles, with reduced active range of motion and guarding—a reflection of acute soft tissue trauma. Deep bruising was visible along her right shoulder, a painful and visible testament to the force of impact.

An MRI conducted at Prime MRI Center confirmed the presence of myofascial injury and inflammation in both the cervical and lumbar regions, substantiating the clinical diagnosis of whiplash and lumbar strain. Though no fractures were identified, the imaging report documented soft tissue edema and muscle spasm.

At Valley Neurology Associates, Isabella underwent further assessment for persistent neuropathic pain and was diagnosed with post-concussive symptoms, contributing to her psychological distress. The physicians consistently linked Isabella’s symptoms and functional limitations to the motor vehicle accident, confirming that these injuries were neither preexisting nor speculative.

## Impact on Daily Life

The consequences of Isabella’s injuries have radiated through every aspect of her life. Professionally, she has endured significant absences from her position as a dental hygienist—a role that requires precision, steady posture, and manual dexterity. Even upon returning to limited duty, her pain has compromised her work quality and confidence, threatening her reputation and livelihood.

At home, Isabella’s capacity for joy and familial presence has been profoundly diminished. Tasks as simple as lifting her young nephew, enjoying an evening walk, or preparing meals have become daunting, sometimes impossible. Once an outgoing and energetic individual, Isabella has grown withdrawn, her social engagements replaced by doctor’s appointments and restless nights. The emotional toll—aggravated by newfound anxiety behind the wheel—has compounded her suffering, eroding the fabric of her daily existence.

## Economic Damages

The tangible financial impact of Isabella’s ordeal is substantial, reflected in both direct and indirect costs stemming from her injuries.

**Medical Care:** Multiple emergency and follow-up visits, specialized imaging, neurology consultation, physical therapy, and chiropractic sessions have generated substantial bills, the compilation of which totals $7,800 to date.

**Lost Income:** According to the *itemized wage chart on page 1 of the supporting documentation*, Isabella suffered significant loss of earnings:
| Pay Period          | Regular Hours | Actual Hours | Hours Lost | Regular Pay | Actual Pay | Lost Wages |
|---------------------|---------------|--------------|------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| 11/21–11/25         | 40            | 0            | 40         | $1,200      | $0         | $1,200     |
| 11/26–12/02         | 40            | 0            | 40         | $1,200      | $0         | $1,200     |
| 12/03–12/09         | 40            | 20           | 20         | $1,200      | $600       | $600       |
| 12/10–12/16         | 40            | 30           | 10         | $1,200      | $900       | $300       |
| **Total Lost Wages**|               |              |            |             |            | **$3,300** |

**Additional Damages:** Isabella has also incurred transportation expenses and over-the-counter medication costs amounting to $270, and she faces ongoing financial burden due to decreased work capacity.

**Total Economic Damages:** $7,800 (medical) + $3,300 (lost wages) + $270 (incidental) = **$11,370**

## Ongoing and Future Care Needs

Despite months of conscientious effort, Isabella’s pain and restricted motion persist. Her providers at Costa Vista Chiropractic and Valley Neurology Associates anticipate the need for continued chiropractic therapy and periodic pain management, likely extending six to eight months into the future. She may also require counseling to address lingering driving anxiety and insomnia.

Projected additional medical expenses are estimated at $2,500. If symptoms become chronic, Isabella could face further loss of earning capacity, as prolonged absenteeism or work restrictions may threaten her current employment. The specter of lasting discomfort and recurrent flare-ups is a sobering reality, shadowing her prospects for a full return to pre-accident life.

## Comparable Case Precedent

In **Rogers v. Ramone Transportation, Inc.** (Maricopa County Superior Court, 2019), the plaintiff—a woman in her mid-30s—was similarly rear-ended at a stoplight and diagnosed with cervical and lumbar strains as well as anxiety. Despite diligent care, her recovery stretched over seven months, mirroring Isabella’s journey. The case culminated in a jury verdict of $85,000, covering medical expenses, wage loss, and emotional distress. Significantly, the court recognized the lasting impact of chronic pain and anxiety, even in the absence of fractures or permanent disability. Like Isabella, the plaintiff in Rogers endured months of lost wages, ongoing care, and emotional harm due to another driver’s clear negligence.



## Precedent

In a local precedent case, **Rogers v. Ramone Transportation, Inc.** (Maricopa County Superior Court, 2019), the plaintiff who was a woman in her 30s was rear-ended in a similar fashion to Isabella. She was diagnosed with cervical, lumbar strains and anxiety. Even after dedicated treatment, her recovery stretched over seven months. The court recognized the lasting impact of chronic pain, anxiety in the absence of fractures or permanent disability.The plaintiff received a jury verdict of $85,000 that covered medical expenses, wage loss, emotional distress and suffering from chronic pain. 

Furthermore, the overall average personal injury settlement for car accident in Arizona ranges from $7,500-$25,000 according to one source, while another indicates $10,000-$75,000 for minor to moderate injuries. These cases often include factors such as whiplash and other soft tissue injuries, PTSD, and ongoing treatment needs—similar to the circumstances we see in Isabella's case. Isabella's damages, from medical expenses to lost wages, are well-documented, strengthening her claim.

## Settlement

Given the circumstances, precedents, and damages suffered by Isabella Moreno, a settlement demand of $60,000 is proposed. This sum accounts for economic damages documented at $11,370 (consisting of medical expenses, lost wages and incidental costs), but also takes into account the considerable non-economic damages inflicted upon Isabella. 

These non-economic damages include the ongoing physical pain and restrictions she endures as well as the psychological distress she experiences regularly. Her needs for ongoing chiropractic therapy, pain management, and counseling for psychological impacts such as driving anxiety and insomnia can extend beyond the typically awarded $8,000-$20,000 range for pain and suffering for minor to moderate injuries. 

In light of these considerations, we believe that the demand for a $60,000 is fair and just compensation for Ms. Moreno's ongoing crisis inflicted by the negligence of the defendant.
