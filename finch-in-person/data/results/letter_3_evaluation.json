    "Quality of Writing": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 The letter is generally clear and professional, but formatting is uneven (line-break artifacts, inconsistent headings) and occasional phrasing errors prevent it from reaching a polished, persuasive level."
    },
    "Factual Presentation": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Key incident facts (date, time, location, parties, insurance) are correct, yet several source-document details are omitted or altered (e.g., no mention of suspected mild TBI, chronic headaches, or property-damage figure)."
    },
    "Medical Documentation": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Basic injuries and some treatment chronology are listed, but important objective findings (MRI disc bulges, EMG, post-concussion issues) and supporting records are absent, and future-care projections lack cited medical authority, triggering the critical-failure cap."
    },
    "Damages Calculation": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Although an itemized economic chart is supplied, the $25,000 demand exceeds the shown $18,315 subtotal without a step-by-step calculation or multiplier to bridge the gap, invoking the critical-failure limit."
    },
    "Precedent and Legal Authority": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 The letter references several verdicts with comparable injuries, but citations are cursory (\u201c[1]\u201d) and lack jurisdictional analysis or persuasive tie-ins to Arizona law, so the treatment is adequate but not thorough."
    },
    "Legal Strategy": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Liability is clearly assigned and a per-diem method is employed, yet there is little strategic framing (e.g., policy-limits discussion, comparative-fault rebuttal) to strengthen bargaining leverage."
    },
    "Settlement Justification": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 The narrative gestures toward economic, non-economic, and future damages, but fails to reconcile the numerical gap to $25,000 or explain why that figure is reasonable relative to the cited precedents."
    },
    "Source Document Representation": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Several factual mismatches (lower medical total than source, omission of property damage, exclusion of neurological findings) and partial injury list reduce accuracy and completeness."
