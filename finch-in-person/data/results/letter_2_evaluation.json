      "score": 4,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Core facts (date, time, place, parties, rear-end mechanism, insurance data) are accurately stated and consistent with the source record, though vehicle speed and several secondary details are omitted."

      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Injuries are listed only in generalized terms, key diagnoses such as post-concussion syndrome and headaches are omitted, and there is no chart or exhibit actually attached; the narrative is therefore incomplete and lightly supported."

      "explanation": "\u2013 No numerical breakdown of medical bills ($7,760), wage loss ($3,300), or property damage ($2,367.48) is provided, and the $100,000 demand is unsupported by arithmetic, triggering the critical-failure cap."

      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Liability is asserted clearly and a 20-day response deadline is imposed, but the strategy is rudimentary and lacks leverage points such as bad-faith exposure or comparative verdict analysis."

      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Because the demand is not tied to an itemized total or multiplier analysis, the rationale for a full-policy payout is weak and largely conclusory."
