      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Key incident facts (date, time, location, parties, rear-end mechanism) are correctly stated, but property-damage figures and precise wage-loss dates from the source file are omitted."

    "Medical Documentation": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Injuries, providers, and general progress are summarized, yet the chronology lacks specific dates of each visit, CPT-coded bills, or physician opinions tying symptoms to future care."

    "Damages Calculation": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Other than a blanket policy-limit request, the letter provides no mathematical breakdown of the $7,760 medical bills, $3,300 lost wages, or $2,367 vehicle damage, triggering the critical cap."

    "Legal Strategy": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 While liability is asserted and a 20-day deadline set, the absence of authority, negotiation anchors, or discussion of bad-faith exposure keeps strategy rudimentary (capped at 3, scored lower for thin execution)."
    },
    "Settlement Justification": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 The policy-limit figure is asserted without showing how total special damages translate to a $100,000 value or referencing multiplier analysis, making the rationale weak."

    "Source Document Representation": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Facts presented are generally accurate, but notable omissions (property repair cost, exact lost-wage period, post-concussion diagnosis) and no misstatements place it at a merely adequate level."
