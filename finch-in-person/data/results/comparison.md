## Category Comparison


### Structure and Organization

- letter_2.pdf: N/A/5 - No explanation provided
- letter_1.pdf: N/A/5 - No explanation provided

### Factual Presentation

- letter_2.pdf: 3/5 - – Key incident facts (date, time, location, parties, rear-end mechanism) are correctly stated, but property-damage figures and precise wage-loss dates from the source file are omitted.
- letter_1.pdf: 2/5 - – Core facts (date, location, basic mechanism) are correct, yet the letter omits the at-fault driver’s name, lost-wage and property-damage facts, and several documented symptoms (headaches, dizziness, suspected TBI), leaving a materially incomplete factual record.

### Medical Documentation

- letter_2.pdf: 3/5 - – Injuries, providers, and general progress are summarized, yet the chronology lacks specific dates of each visit, CPT-coded bills, or physician opinions tying symptoms to future care.
- letter_1.pdf: 2/5 - – While X-rays, MRIs, chiropractic notes, and some neurology references are recited, future-care projections lack physician support and the concussion-related findings are entirely absent, triggering the critical-failure ceiling of 2.

### Damages Calculation

- letter_1.pdf: 3/5 - – Past medical bills are itemized and a per-diem pain calculation is shown, but the omission of lost wages and property damage, coupled with round-number future-care estimates lacking hard backup, keeps the analysis at an adequate but unsophisticated level.
- letter_2.pdf: 2/5 - – Other than a blanket policy-limit request, the letter provides no mathematical breakdown of the $7,760 medical bills, $3,300 lost wages, or $2,367 vehicle damage, triggering the critical cap.

### Legal Strategy

- letter_2.pdf: 2/5 - – While liability is asserted and a 20-day deadline set, the absence of authority, negotiation anchors, or discussion of bad-faith exposure keeps strategy rudimentary (capped at 3, scored lower for thin execution).
- letter_1.pdf: 2/5 - – Liability is asserted and a 15-day deadline with bad-faith language is included, yet the demand is mistakenly sent to GEICO (not the carrier on record) and frames the case as an underinsured-motorist claim without laying the contractual foundation, weakening strategic leverage.

### Persuasiveness

- letter_2.pdf: N/A/5 - No explanation provided
- letter_1.pdf: N/A/5 - No explanation provided

### Source Document Representation

- letter_2.pdf: 3/5 - – Facts presented are generally accurate, but notable omissions (property repair cost, exact lost-wage period, post-concussion diagnosis) and no misstatements place it at a merely adequate level.
- letter_1.pdf: 2/5 - – Several key source facts are correctly mirrored, yet multiple omissions (lost wages, property damage, post-concussion symptoms) and the insurer misidentification show only partial, sometimes inaccurate, use of the provided material.
