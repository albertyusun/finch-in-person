2. letter_2.pdf - Score: 2.40

## Category Comparison


### Structure and Organization

- letter_2.pdf: 3/5 - – The letter follows the customary headings and sequence, but the repeated headers and formatting glitches create an unpolished, slightly confusing appearance that detracts from otherwise adequate organization.
- letter_1.pdf: 3/5 - – The letter follows a recognizable demand-letter format with labeled sections, but the layout is cluttered (irregular line breaks, missing pagination, inconsistent tables) and hinders quick review.

### Factual Presentation

- letter_2.pdf: 4/5 - – Core facts (date, time, place, parties, rear-end mechanism, insurance data) are accurately stated and consistent with the source record, though vehicle speed and several secondary details are omitted.
- letter_1.pdf: 3/5 - – Core incident facts (date, location, speed, rear-end mechanism) are accurate, yet the narrative omits the at-fault driver’s name, insurance details, property damage figure, and lost-wage period, leaving important facts under-developed.

### Medical Documentation

- letter_2.pdf: 2/5 - – Injuries are listed only in generalized terms, key diagnoses such as post-concussion syndrome and headaches are omitted, and there is no chart or exhibit actually attached; the narrative is therefore incomplete and lightly supported.
- letter_1.pdf: 2/5 - – While acute cervical/lumbar findings and imaging are described, the letter ignores documented post-concussion/TBI symptoms and provides future-care projections without citing any treating-provider prognosis, triggering the critical-failure cap.

### Damages Calculation

- letter_1.pdf: 3/5 - – Past medical bills are itemized and the per-diem pain calculation is shown, but lost wages ($3,300) and property damage ($2,367.48) are missing, and the $10,240 gap between calculated damages and the $50,000 demand is not mathematically tied to evidence.
- letter_2.pdf: 2/5 - – No numerical breakdown of medical bills ($7,760), wage loss ($3,300), or property damage ($2,367.48) is provided, and the $100,000 demand is unsupported by arithmetic, triggering the critical-failure cap.

### Legal Strategy

- letter_2.pdf: 3/5 - – Liability is asserted clearly and a 20-day response deadline is imposed, but the strategy is rudimentary and lacks leverage points such as bad-faith exposure or comparative verdict analysis.
- letter_1.pdf: 3/5 - – Liability is asserted (rear-end presumption), a 15-day response deadline and bad-faith warning are included, yet there is little discussion of policy limits, comparative fault, or venue leverage that would elevate strategic depth.

### Persuasiveness

- letter_2.pdf: 3/5 - – Tone is professional and the request for policy limits is clear, yet duplication errors and thin evidentiary discussion diminish overall impact.
- letter_1.pdf: 3/5 - – Tone is professional and the demand is clear, but typographical errors and missing damages reduce overall impact.

### Source Document Representation

- letter_2.pdf: 3/5 - – Major facts match the provided summary, but the duration of treatment (“months of pain”) is exaggerated and several documented injuries are omitted.
- letter_1.pdf: 3/5 - – Most key facts are correctly drawn from the summary, but several documented injuries (headaches, dizziness, blurred vision) and economic losses (lost wages, vehicle repair) are omitted, and nothing is misstated.
