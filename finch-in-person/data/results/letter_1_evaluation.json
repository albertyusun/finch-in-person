      "explanation": "\u2013 The letter follows a recognizable demand-letter format with labeled sections, but the layout is cluttered (irregular line breaks, missing pagination, inconsistent tables) and hinders quick review."
    },
    "Factual Presentation": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Core incident facts (date, location, speed, rear-end mechanism) are accurate, yet the narrative omits the at-fault driver\u2019s name, insurance details, property damage figure, and lost-wage period, leaving important facts under-developed."
    },
    "Medical Documentation": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 While acute cervical/lumbar findings and imaging are described, the letter ignores documented post-concussion/TBI symptoms and provides future-care projections without citing any treating-provider prognosis, triggering the critical-failure cap."
    },
    "Damages Calculation": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Past medical bills are itemized and the per-diem pain calculation is shown, but lost wages ($3,300) and property damage ($2,367.48) are missing, and the $10,240 gap between calculated damages and the $50,000 demand is not mathematically tied to evidence."
    },
    "Precedent and Legal Authority": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 A single comparable verdict is cited with docket reference, but no additional authorities or statutory references are offered and the discussion is surface-level."
    },
    "Legal Strategy": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Liability is asserted (rear-end presumption), a 15-day response deadline and bad-faith warning are included, yet there is little discussion of policy limits, comparative fault, or venue leverage that would elevate strategic depth."
    },
    "Persuasiveness": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Tone is professional and the demand is clear, but typographical errors and missing damages reduce overall impact."

    "Settlement Justification": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 The letter links $39,760 in special/general damages to a $50,000 ask, but does not convincingly explain why the extra amount is warranted beyond a vague reference to \u201cseverity\u201d and \u201congoing risk.\u201d"
    },
    "Source Document Representation": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Most key facts are correctly drawn from the summary, but several documented injuries (headaches, dizziness, blurred vision) and economic losses (lost wages, vehicle repair) are omitted, and nothing is misstated."
