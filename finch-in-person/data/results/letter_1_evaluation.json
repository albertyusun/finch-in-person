    "Quality of Writing": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 The letter is generally professional and coherent but marred by noticeable typographical / spacing errors, occasional awkward phrasing, and some organizational inconsistencies that detract from an otherwise competent narrative."
    },
    "Factual Presentation": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Core facts (date, location, basic mechanism) are correct, yet the letter omits the at-fault driver\u2019s name, lost-wage and property-damage facts, and several documented symptoms (headaches, dizziness, suspected TBI), leaving a materially incomplete factual record."
    },
    "Medical Documentation": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 While X-rays, MRIs, chiropractic notes, and some neurology references are recited, future-care projections lack physician support and the concussion-related findings are entirely absent, triggering the critical-failure ceiling of 2."
    },
    "Damages Calculation": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Past medical bills are itemized and a per-diem pain calculation is shown, but the omission of lost wages and property damage, coupled with round-number future-care estimates lacking hard backup, keeps the analysis at an adequate but unsophisticated level."
    },
    "Precedent and Legal Authority": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 One analogous verdict is cited with basic facts and a pinpoint citation; however, it is out-of-jurisdiction (California) and no statutory or Arizona case law is included, limiting the depth of authority."
    },
    "Legal Strategy": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Liability is asserted and a 15-day deadline with bad-faith language is included, yet the demand is mistakenly sent to GEICO (not the carrier on record) and frames the case as an underinsured-motorist claim without laying the contractual foundation, weakening strategic leverage."
    },
    "Settlement Justification": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 The $50,000 figure is tied to enumerated specials and a verdict analogy, but the failure to include all economic damages and the use of broad, unsupported future-care numbers undercut the persuasiveness of the ask."
    },
    "Source Document Representation": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Several key source facts are correctly mirrored, yet multiple omissions (lost wages, property damage, post-concussion symptoms) and the insurer misidentification show only partial, sometimes inaccurate, use of the provided material."
