    "Quality of Writing": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 The letter employs generally professional tone and structure but is marred by noticeable typographical spacing errors (\u201cEV ALUATION\u201d), uneven formatting of dollar figures, and occasional awkward phrasing that undercuts overall polish."
    },
    "Factual Presentation": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Key collision facts (date, location, mechanism, speed) are accurate, yet the letter omits the at-fault driver\u2019s name, excludes time of accident, and miscites the insurer (GEICO instead of Guardian/State Farm), leaving several material facts incomplete or incorrect."
    },
    "Medical Documentation": {
      "score": 2,
      "explanation": "\u2013 While it summarizes ER care, chiropractic course, MRI findings, and improvements, it wholly omits the documented post-concussion syndrome/headaches and offers future-care projections without any treating-provider opinions, triggering the critical-failure cap of 2."
    },
    "Damages Calculation": {
      "score": 4,
      "explanation": "\u2013 The author supplies a categorical breakdown with arithmetic that ties past medicals, future medical estimates, and per-diem pain calculations to a stated total, though lost wages and property damage are inexplicably excluded and some figures are mis-formatted."
    },
    "Precedent and Legal Authority": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 A single California soft-tissue rear-end verdict is cited with docket number and facts, but jurisdiction is non-analogous (AZ claim) and no statutory or policy-language authority is referenced."
    },
    "Legal Strategy": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Liability is asserted, a fifteen-day response deadline and bad-faith threat are used, yet the UIM demand is directed to the wrong carrier and the policy-limit context is never specified, reducing strategic weight."
    },
    "Settlement Justification": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 The $50,000 demand is linked to an itemized $39,760 damage table and a modest premium for general damages, but failure to include lost wages or property damage dulls the persuasive rationale."
    },
    "Source Document Representation": {
      "score": 3,
      "explanation": "\u2013 Most injury and treatment facts match the source, yet the letter misstates insurers, omits concussion-related symptoms, drops the $3,300 lost-wage claim and $2,367.48 vehicle damage, reflecting partial but not complete fidelity."
