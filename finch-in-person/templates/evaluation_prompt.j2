## Source Document Facts

The following facts have been extracted from the source documents:

## Demand Letter to Evaluate

{{ demand_letter_content }}

## Evaluation Criteria (Score 1-5)

Please evaluate the demand letter on a scale of 1-5 for each category:

1 = Poor (Minimal effort, major deficiencies, fails to meet basic requirements)
2 = Fair (Attempts to address requirements but with significant gaps)
3 = Adequate (Meets basic requirements but lacks sophistication or detail)
4 = Comprehensive (Includes the most relevant elements with thorough coverage)
5 = Exceptional (Includes the most relevant expected elements with additional strategic flair)

For each category, provide:
- A numeric score (1-5)
- A one-sentence explanation for your score

## CRITICAL FAILURE CONDITIONS
The following conditions will automatically limit scores:
- If a letter demands a settlement amount without specific mathematical justification → maximum score of 2 in Damages Calculation
- If a letter lacks case precedent or legal authority → maximum score of 3 in Legal Strategy
- If calculations don't include a clear breakdown by category → maximum score of 3 in Damages Calculation
- If future medical expenses are claimed without supporting evidence → maximum score of 2 in Medical Documentation

### Evaluation Categories

   - **Reasonableness/Proportionality**: Is the final demand reasonable and proportional to the documented damages?
   
6. Precedent and Legal Authority:
