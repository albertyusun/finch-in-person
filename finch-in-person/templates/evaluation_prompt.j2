# Legal Demand Letter Evaluation

## Instructions

You are an expert legal evaluator tasked with assessing the quality of a demand letter in a personal injury case. Please carefully review the provided letter against the source document facts and evaluate it based on the enhanced criteria below. 

This evaluation system is intentionally rigorous and critical. High scores should only be given to truly exceptional work that meets ALL of the specified criteria for that level.

## Source Document Facts

The following facts have been extracted from the source documents:

{{ source_document_facts }}

## Demand Letter to Evaluate

{{ demand_letter_content }}

## Evaluation Criteria (Score 1-5)

Please evaluate the demand letter on a scale of 1-5 for each category:

1 = Poor (Minimal effort, major deficiencies, fails to meet basic requirements)
2 = Fair (Attempts to address requirements but with significant gaps)
3 = Adequate (Meets basic requirements but lacks sophistication or detail)
4 = Comprehensive (Includes ALL expected elements with thorough coverage)
5 = Exceptional (Includes ALL expected elements plus additional strategic elements)

For each category, provide:
- A numeric score (1-5)
- A one-sentence explanation for your score

## CRITICAL FAILURE CONDITIONS
The following conditions will automatically limit scores:
- If a letter demands a settlement amount without specific mathematical justification → maximum score of 2 in Damages Calculation
- If a letter lacks case precedent or legal authority → maximum score of 3 in Legal Strategy
- If calculations don't include a clear breakdown by category → maximum score of 3 in Damages Calculation
- If future medical expenses are claimed without supporting evidence → maximum score of 2 in Medical Documentation

### Evaluation Categories

1. Structure and Organization (10%): How well is the letter organized with clear sections, logical flow, and effective formatting?
   
2. Factual Presentation (10%): How accurately and clearly are the incident details presented, including specificity of dates, times, and locations?
   
3. Medical Documentation (15%): How thoroughly are the injuries described, treatment timeline presented, and objective medical evidence included?
   
4. Damages Calculation (25%): 
   - **Mathematical Justification (15%)**: How thoroughly does the letter show actual calculations and breakdowns of amounts claimed?
   - **Evidence-Based Valuation (5%)**: How well are the claimed amounts tied to specific documentary evidence?
   - **Reasonableness/Proportionality (5%)**: Is the final demand reasonable and proportional to the documented damages?
   
5. Precedent and Legal Authority (10%):
   - How effectively does the letter cite relevant cases, verdicts, or settlements?
   - How well are legal authorities integrated into the argument?
   
6. Legal Strategy (5%): How effectively does the letter establish liability and employ negotiation tactics?
   
7. Persuasiveness (10%): How professional is the tone, how clear is the demand, and how compelling is the overall case presentation?
   
8. Settlement Justification (10%): How well does the letter justify the specific settlement amount demanded through reasoning, calculation, and evidence?
   
9. Source Document Representation (5%): How accurately does the letter reflect information from source documents without misrepresentation or omission?
